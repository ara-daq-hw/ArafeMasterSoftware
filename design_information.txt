Design Information

There will be three components of the software
1: ArafeD -- the main program
2: Arafe -- abstraction of the ArafeD functions
2: ArafeI2C -- the program that executes the ArafeD functions through the I2C interface
3: atriComponents -- handles enabling/disabling component stuff on the ATRI board
